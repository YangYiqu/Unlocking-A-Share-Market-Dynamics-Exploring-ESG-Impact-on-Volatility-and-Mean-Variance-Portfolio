# Unlocking A-Share Market Dynamics: Exploring ESG Impact on Volatility and Mean-Variance Portfolio
## Fma4200 Project

**Research Question:**
- Verify the impact of corporate ESG scores on stock return volatility in Chinaâ€™s A-share market.
- Introduce ESG Scores to improve the Markowitz Mean Variance Model and study the impact of ESG on mean variance investors' preference.


**Data form:**
- | id | year | esg_score | return |
    |----|------|-----------|--------|



**Primary result:**
- The comparison of three different types of efficient frontier by using the 20 stocks of different levels of ESG is shown below.

  It illustrates the standard mean-variance frontier along with the associated tangent portfolio. The slope from the risk-free rate to the tangent portfolio represents the maximum Sharpe ratio (SR). This tangent portfolio is pivotal in maximizing the risk-adjusted returns given the available assets.

- For each level of ESG, we calculate the highest attainable Sharpe ratio (SR). We represent this association between ESG scores and the highest SR in terms of the ESG-SR frontier. The ESG-SR frontier is a useful way to illustrate the investment opportunity set when people care about risk, return, and ESG. (Risk and return can be summarized by the Sharpe ratio)

**Web Interface:**
- We have developed a lightweight front-end interface tailored to deliver a user-friendly experience. Upon uploading a file, the interface seamlessly showcases the corresponding results derived from the ESG-adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which enhances
user engagement and ensures accessibility to intricate financial analyses.
